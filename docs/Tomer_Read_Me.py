"""
In here I will write all the tasks i struggles with.

1.  Using testing to test my code with the Player class....
    I tried using the UNITEST module but feels a bit limited, or maybe im not sure how to use it
    here is a simple video about it --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tNS--WetLI
    here is the docs --> https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.debug
    You can see on the Test_X(X stands for any file that starts with Test is a testing) for my tries

2.  I tried splitting it into 2 directories(Testing, Working), but got stuck with the importing.
    I searched online for solution, but couldn't get them right for some reason...


3.
